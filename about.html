        <p>If you can dream it we can design it! Yummy Tummy Treats all the way!

            Since opened in 10th November 2012 Cake City has made tremendous growth and in a span of few months grasped all the cake lovers. Our ambition to serve many has seen us grown from one humble branch to 5 branches so far and still growing.
            
            Our bakers make sure that they use only finest ingredients and advanced baking techniques to deliver taste, quality and freshness.
            
            Our Flagship Westlands Branch next to PrideCentre & Soin Arcade is elaborately structured in the form of an attractive Strawberry Cake dripping with chocolate.
            Take a bite on any of Cake City wonderfully textured and freshly baked cake slices, pies, and pastries, which through these years have become an all-time family favorite across Nairobi. We also have in our line: our Firewood Baked Pizzas, our own Cake City Style Puffs, Croissants, Danishes and Rolls that have made us very famous.
